Hepatitis C Prediction using Machine Learning
About

This project uses machine learning to predict Hepatitis C using official medical data. The main idea is to test different ML models and see which one performs best for early detection.

Dataset

Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository (official public data)

Includes age, gender, and liver blood test values

Output: Healthy / Hepatitis / Fibrosis / Cirrhosis

Models Used

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

SVM

KNN

Naive Bayes

Gradient Boosting

How it Works

Load and clean the dataset

Train multiple ML models

Compare results using accuracy and other metrics

Tools

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Result

Random Forest performed the best. This shows machine learning can help in early Hepatitis C detection.
